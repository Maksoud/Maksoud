### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Renée Maksoud and I live in Maceió, Alagoas - Brazil

* For nearly a decade I have developed my skills to restructure entire IT environments, promoting a new low-cost end-user experience for business by showing that more can be done at a lower cost through a well-sized network, demand-proportional servers and well-configured resources on server-specific operating systems.
* My main goal is to keep all of the interesting parts performing their activities to the maximum, bringing comfort, availability, security, and agility. Always seeking to maintain the most cost-effective resources of the company.
* Initially, I could successfully finish the Microsoft certified networking course and after I did my degree in System Analysis and Development and an MBA in IT governance.
* I have extensive experience in HelpDesk, local IT support, ERP support, CRM support, Linux and Windows Server operating systems. I also have software development skills
